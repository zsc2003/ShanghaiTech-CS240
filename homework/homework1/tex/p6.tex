\solution{}

Suppose you have a graph with $n$ nodes. Initially the graph contains no edges, and your task is to add a set of directed edges to the graph so that for any pair of nodes $i$ and $j$ where $i < j$, there is a path from $i$ to $j$ using at most 2 of the edges you added. You can only add edges of the form $(i,j)$ for $i < j$.  Give an algorithm to find a set of $O(n \log n)$ edges which satisfy this requirement.

For a set of points, we can split them from the middle, and generate two new set of points $A,B$.\\

Then we set edge from each points in $A$ to each points in $B$.\\

For set $A,B$, recursively do the above steps.

So the total number of connected edges $T(n)$ has the relation that 
$$T(n)=2T(\dfrac{n}{2})+O(n)$$

So $T(n)=n\log n$.\\
