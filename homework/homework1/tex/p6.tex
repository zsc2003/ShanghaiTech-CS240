\problem{}
Suppose you have a graph with $n$ nodes. Initially the graph contains no edges, and your task is to add a set of directed edges to the graph so that for any pair of nodes $i$ and $j$ where $i < j$, there is a path from $i$ to $j$ using at most 2 of the edges you added. You can only add edges of the form $(i,j)$ for $i < j$.  Give an algorithm to find a set of $O(n \log n)$ edges which satisfy this requirement.
