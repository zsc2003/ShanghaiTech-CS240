\problem{}
Suppose you have a graph with $n$ nodes.  Initially the graph contains no edges, and your task is to add a set of undirected edges to the graph so that for any pair of nodes $i$ and $j$, there is a path between $i$ and $j$ using at most 2 of the edges you added.  Give an algorithm to find a set of $O(n \log n)$ edges which satisfy this requirement.
