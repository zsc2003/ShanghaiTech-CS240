\problem{}
Suppose you have two arrays each with $n$ values, and all the values are unique.  You want to find the median of the $2n$ values, i.e. the $n$'th smallest value.  To do this you can make queries to either array, where a query for $k$ to an array returns the $k$'th smallest value in that array.  Give an algorithm which finds the median of the two arrays using $O(\log n)$ queries.  

\solution{}










So above all, with $O(\log n)$ queries, we can find the median of the two arrays.\\
