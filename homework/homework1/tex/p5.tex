\problem{}
Suppose $n$ contestants will participate in a set of contests $G$.  In each contest the contestants are split into two teams, possibly of different sizes, and such that each team contains at least one contestant.  We require that for any two contestants, there is some contest in $G$ in which these contestants are on different teams.  Design the contests in $G$ in order to minimize the total number of contests $|G|$.
