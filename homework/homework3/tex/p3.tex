\problem{}
Consider a restaurant with $m$ different menu items.  Each customer to the restaurant has a set of items they are willing to order.  The restaurant makes $d_i$ amount of item $i$, for $1 \leq i \leq m$, so that at most $d_i$ customers can order item $i$.  Given $n$ customers, where the $j$'th customer has a list $C_j$ of items they are willing to order, design an efficient algorithm to maximize the number of customers you can serve.
