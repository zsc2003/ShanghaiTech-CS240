Given a set $C$, a collection $D$ of subsets of $C$, and a value $k$, the $k$-SET-PACKING problem asks if there exist $k$ subsets from $D$ which are mutually disjoint, i.e. no two of the subsets share an element.  Show that the SET-PACKING problem is in NP.

\solution{}

1. Verifier. \\
Certificate $D_1,D_2,\cdots,D_k$ are $k$ subsets from $D$.\\
Check whether the $k$ are mutually disjoint.\\
If so, output $1$, otherwise, output $0$.\\

2. If $D$ is yes instance. \\
Then there exist a combination of $k$ subsets from $D$ which are mutually disjoint.\\
Let $D_1,\cdots,D_k$ be this assignment, and give it to $V$.\\
Clearly, $V$ outputs $1$.\\

3. If $D$ is no instance. \\
Then there has no combination of $k$ subsets from $D$ which are mutually disjoint.\\
So no matter how we combine the $k$ subsets from $D$, there will also exists unions.\\
So $V$ outputs $0$, for any input $D_1,\cdots,D_k$.\\

4. $V$ runs in polynomial time. \\
If each subset $D_i$ has atmost $|C|$ element, then to check each pair of sets $D_i,D_j$ will have $|C|^2$ time.\\
And there are total $O(k^2)$ pairs.\\
So $V$ runs in $O(k^2|C|)$ time, which is a polynomial time.\\

So above all, we have proved that the $k$-SET-PACKING problem is in NP.
