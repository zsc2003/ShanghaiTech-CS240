\problem{}
Consider the following problem about scheduling courses.  The problem is defined by 3 sets $C$, $S$ and $R$.  Here, $C$ represents a set of  courses, $S$ repreesents the available time slots for the courses, and $R$ contains a collection of course requests from students, where each request is a subset of $C$ representing the the courses that a particular student wishes to take.  The goal is to schedule all the courses without any conflicts.  

For example, if $C = \{a, b, c, d\}, S = \{1, 2, 3\}, R = \{\{a, b, c\}, \{a, b, d\}, \{b, d\}\}$, then it is possible to schedule the courses without conflicts by assigning course $a$ to time slot 1, $b$ to slot $2$ and $c, d$ to slot 3.  However, if $C = \{a, b, c, d\}, S = \{1, 2, 3\}, R = \{\{a, b, c\}, \{a, c\}, \{b, c, d\}\}$, then it is not possible to schedule the courses without any conflicts.  Prove that the problem of determining whether a conflict-free schedule exists is NP-complete. \\

\noindent  \emph{Hint:}  Use a reduction from the 3-COLOR problem.
