\problem{}
Consider an $n \times n$ grid containing $n$ rows and $n$ columns of vertices.  Each vertex $(i, j)$ has edges to four neighbors $(i-1, j)$, $(i+1, j)$, $(i, j-1)$, $(i, j+1)$, except for the boundary vertices, which have edges to two or three neighbors.  Each vertex and edge also has a positive integer capacity.  We are given $m $ start vertices, and for each vertex we want to find a path which connects the vertex to an arbitrary vertex on the grid's boundary.  Furthermore, we need to ensure that the number of paths which pass through each vertex or edge does not exceed its capacity.  Give an algorithm to determine whether this is possible. \\

\noindent \emph{Hint:}  First transform the graph to convert the vertex capacities to edge capacities.
