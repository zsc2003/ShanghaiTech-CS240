\problem{}
We are given an $n \times m$ array of cells. Denote the cell in the $r$'th row and the $c$'th column as $(r,c)$, where $1 \leq r \leq n$ and $1 \leq c \leq m$. A robot is at cell $(1, 1)$ and wants to reach cell $(n, m)$. From cell $(x, y)$, the robot can only move to $(x,y+1)$ or $(x+1,y)$. In addition, some cells contain impassable obstacles and the robot cannot move to these cells. Your goal is to put additional obstacles in the minimum number of cells (other than cell $(n, m)$) such that the robot cannot reach $(n, m)$.  Find an algorithm based on max flow.
