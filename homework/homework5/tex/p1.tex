\problem{}
Suppose you have $2n$ balls and 2 bins.  For each ball, you throw it randomly into one of the bins.  Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ denote the number of balls in the two bins after this process.  Prove that for any  $\varepsilon>0$,  there is a constant  $c>0$  such that the probability $\operatorname{Pr}\left[X_{1}-X_{2}>c \sqrt{n}\right] \leq \varepsilon.$
