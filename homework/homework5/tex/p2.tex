\problem{}
Suppose that for a certain decision problem, we have an algorithm which computes the correct answer with a probability  at least 2/3 on any instance.  We wish to reduce the error probability by running the algorithm $n$ times on the same input, using independent randomness between trials, and taking the most common result as the final answer. Using Chernoff bounds, provide an upper bound on the probability that this modified algorithm produces an incorrect result.
