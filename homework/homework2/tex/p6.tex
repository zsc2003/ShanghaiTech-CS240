\problem{}
Consider a weighted directed graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, where each edge $(i,j)$ has a positive integer weight $w_{i, j}$. A  walk is a sequence of not necessarily distinct vertices $v_1, v_2, ..., v_k$, such that any two consecutive vertices $v_i, v_{i+1}$ are connected by an edge. The length of the walk is the sum of the weights of the edges in the walk.  Design an algorithm to find the number of different walks from a vertex $s$ to another vertex $t$ which have length exactly $L$, and analyze the time complexity of your algorithm.

For loop in the pseudo-code is form `$\textbf{for } i \gets 1 \textbf{ to } n$' represents $i=1,2,\cdots,n$ sequentially.
\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{Number of different walks}\label{alg:problem-6}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State \textbf{Input:} Graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges with weight $w_{i,j}$
    \State \textbf{Output:} The number of different walks from $s$ to $t$ with length $L$
    
    \State $dp(s,0) \gets 1$
    \State $dp(x,t) \gets 0, \forall (x,t)\neq (s,0)$
    
    \For{$val \gets 1$ \textbf{to} $L$}
        \For{$(i, j)\in E$}
            \State $dp(j,val) \gets dp(j,val)+dp(i, val-w_{i,j})$
        \EndFor
    \EndFor
    \State \textbf{return} $dp(t,L)$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The time complexity is $O(mL)$.\\
The space complexity is $O(nL)$.\\
Where $n$ is the number of vertices, $m$ is the number of edges, $L$ is the length of the walk.\\
