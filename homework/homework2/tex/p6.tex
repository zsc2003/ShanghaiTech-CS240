\problem{}
Consider a weighted directed graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, where each edge $(i,j)$ has a positive integer weight $w_{i, j}$. A  walk is a sequence of not necessarily distinct vertices $v_1, v_2, ..., v_k$, such that any two consecutive vertices $v_i, v_{i+1}$ are connected by an edge. The length of the walk is the sum of the weights of the edges in the walk.  Design an algorithm to find the number of different walks from a vertex $s$ to another vertex $t$ which have length exactly $L$, and analyze the time complexity of your algorithm.

Let $dp(x, val)$ to be the number of different walks from $s$ to $x$ with length $val$.\\
Where $x$ is a vertex in the graph.\\
The initial condition is set to be $dp(s,0)=1$, and $dp(x,t)=0, \forall (x,t)\neq (s,0)$.\\
Then we have the following recursive formula:\\
For each edge $(i,j)\in E$, then the number of different walks from $s$ to $j$ with length $val$ is the sum of the number of different walks from $s$ to $i$ with length $val-w_{i,j}$.\\
So we have the following recursive formula:
$$dp(j,val) = dp(j,val)+dp(i, val-w_{i,j})$$
Then we just need to take every edge into consideration, and update the

The pseudo-code is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:problem-6}.\\
For loop in the pseudo-code in form `$\textbf{for } i \gets 1 \textbf{ to } n$' represents $i=1,2,\cdots,n$ sequentially.

                \State $dp(j,val) \gets dp(j,val)+dp(i, val-w_{i,j})$

The time complexity is $O(mL)$.\\
The space complexity is $O(nL+m)$.\\
Where $n$ is the number of vertices, $m$ is the number of edges, $L$ is the length of the walk.\\
