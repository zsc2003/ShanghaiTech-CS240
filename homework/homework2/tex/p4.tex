\problem{}
Given three sequences $L_1, L_2$ and $L$, design an efficient algorithm to check if $L_1$ and $L_2$ can be interleaved to produce $L$.  For example, the sequences $L_1 = \texttt{aabb}$ and $L_2 = \texttt{cba}$ can be interleaved into sequence $L = \texttt{acabbab}$, but $L_1$ and $L_2$ cannot be interleaved into sequence $L = \texttt{aaabbbc}$.  Analyze the time and space complexity of your algorithm as a function of the lengths of $L_1$ and $L_2$.
