\problem{}
Suppose you need to perform $n$ tasks, and you can only perform one task at a time.  It takes $t_i$ time to perform the $i$'th task, and the task has an importance of $w_i > 0$.  Let $C_i$ be the completion time of the $i$'th task, i.e. the time when you finish performing the task.  Find an ordering of the tasks to minimize their weighted completion time, defined as $\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i  C_i$.  Your algorithm should work in $O(n\log{n})$ time, and you need to analyze the algorithm's time complexity and prove its correctness.
