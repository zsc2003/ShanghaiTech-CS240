\problem{}
Suppose you are given a set of intervals $I_1 = [s_1, t_1], \ldots, I_n = [s_n, t_n]$, which can possibly overlap.  Your task is to select a set of points $p_1, \ldots, p_m$ so that each interval intersects at least one of the points.  Give an algorithm to minimize the number of selected points $m$, and prove that your algorithm is optimal.
