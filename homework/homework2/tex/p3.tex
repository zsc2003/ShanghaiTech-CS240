\problem{}
A thief is planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, and the thief can rob any set of houses, as long as he does not rob any adjacent houses.  Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can steal.

\solution{}








For loop in the pseudo-code is form `$\textbf{for } i \gets 1 \textbf{ to } n$' represents $i=1,2,\cdots,n$ sequentially.
\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{Maximum stolen money}\label{alg:problem-3}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State \textbf{Input:} Number of house $n$, each house's money number $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n$. 
    \State \textbf{Output:} The maximum number of money could steal $ans$.
    \State $dp(1,0) \gets 0, dp(1,1)\gets a_1$
    \For{$i \gets 2$ \textbf{to} $n$}
        \State $dp(i,0) \gets \max\{dp(i-1,0),dp(i-1,1)\}$
        \State $dp(i,0) \gets dp(i-1,0)+a_i$
    \EndFor
    \State $ans \gets \max\{dp(n,0),dp(n,1)\}$
    \State \textbf{return} $ans$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The time complexity is $O(n)$.\\
The space complexity is $O(n)$.\\
Where $n$ is the number of houses.\\
