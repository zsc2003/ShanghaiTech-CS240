\problem{}

Given a set $C$, a collection of subsets of $C$ and an integer $k \geq 1$, the Set-Cover problem asks whether there are at most $k$ subsets from the collection which cover $C$, i.e. whose union includes all of $C$. Show that Set-Cover is NP-complete. Do not use a reduction from a problem which is very similar to Set-Cover.

\solution{}

1. Set-Cover is in NP.\\
Given a collection of subsets of $C$, and the integer $k$, we can visit each subset $C_i$, and mark the elements in $C_i$ as covered.\\ The visit would cost $O(k|C|)$ time, where $|C|$ is the number of elements in $|C|$. Then we check whether all elements in $C$ are covered.\\
So the total time complexity is $O((k+1)|C|)$, which is polynomial.\\
So Set-Cover $\in$ NP.\\

2. Vertex-Cover $\leq_p$ Set-Cover.\\
We can reduce Vertex-Cover to Set-Cover.\\
Given a Vertex-Cover problem, we can construct a Set-Cover problem.\\
Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, we can construct a set $C$ which contains all the edges in $E$.\\
For each vertex $v \in V$, we can construct a subset $C_i$ which contains all the edges incident to $v$.\\

<1> "$\Rightarrow$":\\
Given a Vertex-Cover problem, we can construct a Set-Cover problem.\\
Given a Vertex-Cover problem, we can construct a set $C$ which contains all the edges in $E$.\\
For each vertex $v \in V$, it represents a subset $C_i$, and the edge $e$ connects to $v$ represents an element in $C_i$.\\
Then we can prove that the Vertex-Cover problem has a solution if and only if the Set-Cover problem has a solution and the solution must have at most $k$ vertices.\\

<2> "$\Leftarrow$":\\
If a Set-Cover problem has a solution, then the solution must have at most $k$ subsets.\\
Then we can prove that the Vertex-Cover problem has a solution and the solution must have at most $k$ vertices.\\
Let each subset $C_i$ in the solution corresponds to a vertex $v$ in the solution.\\
And each element in $C_i$ corresponds to an edge $e$ incident to $v$ and a duplicate single node $v'$.\\
Then we can prove that the Vertex-Cover problem has a solution if and only if the Set-Cover problem has a solution and the solution must have at most $k$ vertices.\\

<3> Polynomial Time:\\
The construction of the Set-Cover problem from the Vertex-Cover problem costs $O(|V|+|E|)$ time.\\
Which is a polynomial time.\\

So we have proved that Vertex-Cover $\leq_p$ Set-Cover.\\

Since Vertex-Cover $\in$ NP-complete; Set-Cover $\in$ NP; Vertex-Cover $\leq_p$ Set-Cover.\\
Therefore, Set-Cover $\in$ NP-complete.\\

So above all, we have proved that Set-Cover is a NP-complete problem.
