\problem{}

Given a set $C$, a collection of subsets of $C$ and an integer $k \geq 1$, the Set-Cover problem asks whether there are at most $k$ subsets from the collection which cover $C$, i.e. whose union includes all of $C$. Show that Set-Cover is NP-complete. Do not use a reduction from a problem which is very similar to Set-Cover.
