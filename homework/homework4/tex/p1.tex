\problem{}

Given a set $C$, a collection of subsets of $C$ and an integer $k \geq 1$, the Set-Packing problem asks if there are $k$ subsets from the collection which are pairwise disjoint (i.e. no two sets share an element). Show that the Set-Packing problem is NP-complete.

\solution{}

1. Set-Packing is in NP.\\
For a collection of subsets and an integer \( k \), we can directly check each pair of subsets to verify whether they are pairwise disjoint. There are \( \binom{k}{2} \) pairs of subsets to check, and for each pair, we can check whether they have the same element in $O(|C|)$ time by iterating through the elements, where $|C|$ is the number of elements in the set $C$. So we can verify the solution is valid or not in $O\left(\binom{k}{2}|C|\right)$ time.\\
So Set-Packing $\in$ NP.\\

2. k-CLIQUE $\leq_p$ Set-Packing.\\
We have known that the k-CLIQUE problem is NP-complete.\\
For an instance of k-CLIQUE problem whose graph is $G$, we can construct an instance of Set-Packing.
Let each node $v$ in graph $G$ to be a subset of $C$, every edge $(u,v)$ to be two subsets from $C$, so that the two subsets are disjoint.

<1> "$\Rightarrow$":\\
If $C$ is a yes instance of Set-Packing problem, then we can construct a graph with the above methods, so that it is also a yes instance for the k-CLIQUE problem.

<2> "$\Leftarrow$":\\
If $G$ is a yes-instance for the k-CLIQUE problem, then there must have a clique with $k$ vertices that are all connected, then all the corresponding $k$ subsets are disjoint, then it is a yes-instance to the Set-Packing problem.

<3> Polynomial Time:\\
The reduction constructs a subset for each vertex and assigns the incident edges to each subset, both of which can be accomplished in polynomial time relative to the size of \( V \) and \( E \).\\

So we have proved that Independent Set $\leq_p$ Set-Packing.\\

Since k-CLIQUE $\in$ NP-complete; Set-Packing $\in$ NP; k-CLIQUE $\leq_p$ Set-Packing.\\
Therefore, Set-Packing $\in$ NP-complete.\\

So above all, we have proved that Set-Packing is a NP-complete problem.
