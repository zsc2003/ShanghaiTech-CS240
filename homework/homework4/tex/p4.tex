\problem{}

Consider a list with $n$ positive integers, and suppose we iterate through the numbers one by one in a random order. As we do this, we maintain a variable $b$ equal to the largest number we have seen so far. Initially $b$ is set to 0 . Compute the expected number of times $b$ is updated.

For example, if the input list is $[4,7,5]$, and we iterate through the list in the order $3,1,2$, then $b$ is updated twice, when we see 4 and 7 .
